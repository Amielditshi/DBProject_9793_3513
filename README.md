## Introduction
This project aims to design and implement a relational database system for managing **Netflix content creators** and their related data. The system includes entities such as content creators, agents, contracts, productions, awards, and user feedback.  
The goal is to apply database design principles (up to 3NF), execute SQL operations, and demonstrate multi-method data insertion.
